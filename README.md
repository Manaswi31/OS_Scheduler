# Schedulers
This project consists of two OS Schedulers: Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin Scheduler.
SJF is a non-pre-emptive scheduler in which tasks are executed to completion without pre-emption in the order of their execution.
In Round Robin scheduler, tasks are pre-empted based on a fixed quantum size in the order of their execution and are executed to completion.

1.Input.txt file format consists data as taskNumber, taskDuration, resourceNumber1, resourceUse1, resourceDuration1, resourceNumber2, resourceUse2, resourceDuration2
2.tasks.c implements SJF scheduler
3.tasksRobin.c implements RoundRobin Scheduler
